            <details className="faq-item">
                <summary><h3>What is energy burden?</h3></summary>
                <ul className="link-list">
                    <li>
                        Energy burden refers to the percentage of a household's income spent on home energy
                        bills—such as electricity, heating, and cooling. A household is generally considered
                        overburdened if it spends more than 6% of its income on energy costs.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </details>

            <details className="faq-item">
                <summary><h3>What is energy equity and why does it matter?</h3></summary>
                <ul className="link-list">
                    <li>
                        Energy equity means ensuring all people—regardless of income, race, or housing status—have
                        access to affordable, reliable, and clean energy. High energy burdens can deepen inequality,
                        strain family budgets, and limit access to basic needs like heating or cooling.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </details>

            <details className="faq-item">
                <summary><h3>Who is most affected by high energy burdens in New Jersey?</h3></summary>
                <ul className="link-list">
                    <li>
                        Low-income households, renters, people of color, and those in older or poorly insulated
                        housing are disproportionately affected. Overburdened communities may rely on expensive or
                        inefficient fuels and have less access to clean-energy incentives.
